            Developing this Pac-Man clone was a very rewarding experience. 
            This project was a job vacancy screening test, and I only had one week to do as much as I could. 
        </p>   

         <p class="text w3-justify">
            As with every project I take part in, my first step is to do an initial analysis (thanks to my years of experience as a business analyst) 
            on how I should go about achieving the ultimate goal. I look for references and examples, 
            research how to apply good practices, use patterns, etc. So I dedicated the first day to this activity.

        <div id="tab1" class="w3-container w3-hide accordion-content">

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                I found in several examples from other developers the extensive use of colliders for the entire map and the characters, 
                which did not seem right to me. That approach requires a high resource utilization that compromises the performance. 
            </p>

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                So, I found this fantastic article: 
                <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/132330/the_pacman_dossier.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">
                    The Pac-Man Dossier by Jamey Pittman on Gamasutra 
                </a> - the best Game Design Document I’ve ever seen. 
            </p>

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                From then on, I decided to use a map of nodes, meaning I orient the characters to move from one node to another. 
                Each path intersection contains a node with an array of valid directions, which allows the characters to go forward in one of them.
            </p>

        </div>
            
        <button onclick="myFunction('tab2')" class="w3-button w3-block w3-round color-theme-00 w3-left-align accordion">Ghost Behavior</button>
        <div id="tab2" class="w3-container w3-hide accordion">

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                Ghosts have the original game behaviors: Scatter, Chase, Frightened and Consumed. 
                The frightened and consumed modes are common to all ghosts, while Scatter and Chase are peculiar to each ghost (Blinky, Clyde, Inky, Pinky).
            </p>

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                My architecture was modeled as follow: 
            </p>

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                <!-- <span style="line-height:0.6em; margin-right: 10px;">&#8226;</span> -->
                <span style="line-height:0.6em; margin-right: 10px;">&#10004;</span>
                A ghost parent class plus a class for each one of the four ghosts, with essentially the routine that chooses the next target-node 
                (which is the primary difference between ghosts). 
            </p>

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                <span style="line-height:0.6em; margin-right: 10px;">&#10004;</span>
                A state machine that governs the change between the already mentioned behaviors . 
                Here, I used ScriptableObjects and interfaces, with a manager that exchanges the asset (ScriptableObject data) in each ghost.
            </p>
    
        </div>

        <button onclick="myFunction('tab3')" class="w3-button w3-block w3-round color-theme-00 w3-left-align accordion">Difficulty Level</button>
        <div id="tab3" class="w3-container w3-hide accordion">

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                This game has no limit on the level a player can reach, so to better manage the difficulty and to polish the gameplay, 
                the difficulty has been parametrised with ScriptableObjects assets. So for each level you want to increase the difficulty, 
                just create a new asset with the modified parameters and name it with the number of the level you want. 
            </p>

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                The difficulty controller takes care of switching the difficulty when it finds an asset with the same name as the current level of the game. 
                If there is no asset for the specific level, the parameters of the last one are preserved, so we don't need an asset for each level, 
                only for those we want the difficulty to be increased.
            </p>

        </div>
     
        <button onclick="myFunction('tab4')" class="w3-button w3-block w3-round color-theme-00 w3-left-align accordion">Bonus Items</button>
        <div id="tab4" class="w3-container w3-hide">

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                To control the bonus items spawning on a level, I followed the same strategy used on the difficulty level management: ScriptableObjects. 
                In this case, the parameters are the level number, the amount of bonus points and the desired sprite. 
            </p>

            <p class="text w3-justify">
                This makes it simple to enable or disable the presence of bonus items at any level by simply 
                creating or removing ScriptableObject assets from the corresponding manager.
            </p>
